    <h1>Some Commom Block Tags</h1>
    
    <h2>hr</h2>

    <p>The &lt;hr&gt; elemtn used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still show how it is typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the thag took on a semantic meaning. "semantic break".I will be using if ofent to break up example files when i want to display multiples tags in one file </p><br>
    <hr>

    <h2>Adress</h2>

    <p>The &lt;adress&gt;elements indicate that the text is an adress specific to the page, perhaps contact information for the author.</p><br>

    <address>
        1715 Walmut Blvd <br>
        Ashboula OH 44004
    </address>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Blockquote</h2>

    <p>The &lt;blockquote&gt;element is used for extend quoations. It should incluide the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.</p><br>

    <blockquote>
        "if you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way". Napolean hill
    </blockquote>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>details</h2>

    <p>The &lt;details&gt;element is used in conjuction with the &lt;summary&gt;tg. It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeate use of scripting to opend and close content.It is not supported by all of the browsers yet though</p>

    <details>
        <summary>The summary</summary>
        The rest of the content        
    </details>
    <hr>
    
    <div id="inlinetags">
        <h1>inline tags</h1>

        <h2>span</h2>
        <span>mucho texto</span>

        <h2>citing a source - cite</h2>

        <p>the cite makes it much easier for people and bots to seach the code for this specific information. <br>
        A great referen for these and other elements is <cite><a href="https://www.twitter.comh">https://www.twitter.com</a></cite></p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Defining your abbreviations - abbr</h2>

        <p>The &lt;abbr&gt;will display an abbreviation on the browser. But if a title attribute is specified in the tag, the title will appear when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation. Screen readers also provide the title information. <br>
        The days of the week are often abbreviated: 
        <abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr>
        <abbr title="Monday">Mon</abbr>
        <abbr title="Tuesday">Tues</abbr>
        etc.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Specifying the use of time- time</h2>

<p>The &lt;time&gt; is again a completely semantic tag than can be used to seach for specific information. <br>
The party starts at <time>9:00pm</time><br>
The party took place on <time>New Year's Eve.</time>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Identifying code fragments -code </h2>
<p>The &lt;code&gt;elements tends to be displayed in a different font, but also has the semantic meaning to convey information to as many people as possible. <br>
I have been trying to learn how to write html but my <code>img</code> elements never seem to work.</p>
<hr>

<h2>using subscripts and superscripts -sub and sup</h2>

<p>the &lt;sub&gt; and the &lt;sup&gt; elements are used to create the super and subscript. e.g. (x+y)<sup>3</sup>or H<sub>2</sub>O. In the past, people would often paste mathematical images into the page. But images did'tn convey the same meaning to all users.</p>

    <img src="imgs/icon.png" alt="an icon of images" width="50%">
